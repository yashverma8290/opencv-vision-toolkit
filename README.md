## 📁 Features

| Module                  | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `birdview.py`           | Generates a bird’s eye view of a given image.                              |
| `Color_detection.py`    | Detects specified colors using HSV range via webcam.                        |
| `Image_exploration.py`  | Reads images, resizes, displays color channels.                             |
| `Joining_Image.py`      | Joins multiple images into one grid.                                        |
| `Shape_draw.py`         | Draws basic geometric shapes on images.                                     |
| `Track_bar.py`          | Uses trackbars to fine-tune HSV values in real time.                        |
| `Vidoe_capture.py`      | Captures webcam video and writes to file.                                   |
| `jupyter1.ipynb`        | Interactive testing in Jupyter notebook.                                    |
